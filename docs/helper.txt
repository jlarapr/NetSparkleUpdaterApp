  -a, --appcast-output-directory        Directory to write appcast.xml

  -e, --ext                             (Default: exe) Search for file
                                        extensions. Can be something like "exe"
                                        or include multiple extensions with
                                        something like "exe,msi" (the extensions
                                        list is comma-separated)

  -b, --binaries                        (Default: .) Directory containing
                                        binaries.

  -r, --search-binary-subdirectories    (Default: false) Search subdirectories
                                        of --binaries for binaries

  --single-file                         Single file to add to app cast - if set,
                                        --binaries, --ext, etc. are all ignored

  -f, --file-extract-version            (Default: false) Determine the version
                                        from the file path. Tries each string in
                                        between directory separators that
                                        contains a version number starting from
                                        the end of the path. Only searches the
                                        last four directory items (incl. the
                                        file name) and does not search 'above'
                                        the binary directory (-b option). See
                                        unit tests for what is parseable.

  --file-version                        Use to set the version for a binary
                                        going into an app cast. Note that this
                                        version can only be set once, so when
                                        generating an app cast, make sure you
                                        either: A) have only one binary in your
                                        app cast | B) Utilize the
                                        --reparse-existing parameter so that old
                                        items get picked up. If the generator
                                        finds 2 binaries without any known
                                        version and --file-version is set, then
                                        an error will be emitted.

  -o, --os                              (Default: windows) Operating System
                                        (string must contain one of the
                                        following: windows, mac, linux; can be
                                        string such as 'windows-arm64')

  --description-tag                     (Default: Most recent changes with links
                                        to updates) Text to put in the app cast
                                        <description> tag

  --link-tag                            (Default: ) Text to put in the app cast
                                        <link> tag. Should be your app cast
                                        download URL if you use this.

  -u, --base-url                        (Default: ) Base URL for downloads

  -l, --change-log-url                  (Default: ) Base URL to the location for
                                        your changelog files on some server for
                                        downloading

  -p, --change-log-path                 (Default: ) File path to Markdown
                                        changelog files (expected extension:
                                        .md; version must match AssemblyVersion,
                                        e.g. MyApp 1.0.0.md).

  --change-log-name-prefix              (Default: ) Prefix for change log file
                                        names. By default, the generator
                                        searches for file names with the format
                                        "[Version].md". If you set this to (for
                                        example) "My App", it will search for
                                        file names with the format "My App
                                        [Version].md" as well as "[Version].md".

  -n, --product-name                    (Default: Application) Product name.
                                        This will be used in the app cast
                                        <title>. If you use --reparse-existing,
                                        then this field will be ignored and the
                                        existing product name will be used (if
                                        available).

  -x, --url-prefix-version              (Default: false) Add the version as a
                                        prefix to the download url

  --key-path                            Path to NetSparkle_Ed25519.priv and
                                        NetSparkle_Ed25519.pub files

  --signature-file-extension            (Default: signature) Suffix (without
                                        '.') to append to appcast.xml for
                                        signature file. If you change this, make
                                        sure to also set
                                        AppCastHelper.SignatureFileExtension in
                                        the core NetSparkleUpdater lib

  --output-file-name                    (Default: appcast) Output file name
                                        without the . or extension. Extension is
                                        controlled by whether it is an xml or
                                        json output and is not configurable.
                                        Defaults to 'appcast'. Of course, you
                                        can always change this later on your
                                        own; this option is only for
                                        convenience.

  --use-ed25519-signature-attribute     (Default: false) If true and doing XML
                                        output, the output signature attribute
                                        in the XML will be 'edSignature' rather
                                        than 'signature' to match the original
                                        Sparkle library.

  --public-key-override                 (Default: ) Public key override (ignores
                                        whatever is in the public key file) for
                                        signing binaries. This overrides ALL
                                        other public keys set when verifying
                                        binaries, INCLUDING public key set via
                                        environment variables! If not set, uses
                                        --key-path (if set) or the default
                                        SignatureManager location. Not used in
                                        --generate-keys or --export.

  --private-key-override                (Default: ) Private key override
                                        (ignores whatever is in the private key
                                        file) for signing binaries. This
                                        overrides ALL other private keys set
                                        when signing binaries, INCLUDING private
                                        key set via environment variables! If
                                        not set, uses --key-path (if set) or the
                                        default SignatureManager location. Not
                                        used in --generate-keys or --export.

  --reparse-existing                    (Default: false) Re-parse an existing
                                        app cast rather than overriding it and
                                        creating it anew. Skips versions already
                                        in the app cast, so if you deploy a new
                                        binary with the same version, you will
                                        need to manually edit your app cast to
                                        remove the old listing for the version
                                        you are re-deploying.

  --overwrite-old-items                 (Default: false) If--overwrite-old-items
                                        is used, this option will cause app cast
                                        items to be rewritten in the app cast if
                                        a binary on disk with the same version
                                        number is found. In other words, if
                                        1.0.1 is in the app cast already (either
                                        from reparsing or from another binary),
                                        and another 1.0.1 is found on disk, then
                                        the 1.0.1 data in the app cast will be
                                        rewritten based on the binary found.
                                        Note that this means that if you have
                                        multiple 1.0.1 versions on disk (which
                                        you shouldn't do...), the last one found
                                        will be the one in your app cast! (Uses
                                        semantic versions to check for matches.)

  --human-readable                      (Default: false) If true, makes the
                                        output app cast file human readable
                                        (newslines, indents)

  --critical-versions                   (Default: ) Comma-separated list of
                                        versions to mark as critical in the app
                                        cast. Must match version text exactly.
                                        E.g., "1.0.2,1.2.3.1"

  --channel                             (Default: ) Name of release channel for
                                        any items added into the app cast.
                                        Should be a single channel; does not
                                        support multiple channels at once, e.g.
                                        "beta,gamma". Do not set if you want to
                                        use your release channel - if you set
                                        this to "release" or "stable", those
                                        will be treated as special channels and
                                        not as the stable channel. (Unless you
                                        want all your items to be in a specific
                                        channel, of course.)

  --output-type                         (Default: xml) Output type for app cast
                                        file ('xml' or 'json' without the '
                                        marks); defaults to 'xml'

  --generate-keys                       (Default: false) Generate keys

  --force                               (Default: false) Force regeneration of
                                        keys

  --export                              (Default: false) Export keys

  --generate-signature                  File path to binary to generate a
                                        signature for

  --verify                              Path to file to verify

  --signature                           Signature of file to verify

  --show-examples                       (Default: false) Show extended examples

  --help                                Display this help screen.

  --version                             Display version information.
